      Detected an Expression Language segment that does not escape output. 
      This is dangerous because if any data in this expression can be controlled externally, 
      it is a xss vulnerability.
      Instead, use the 'escapeXml' function or use the 'out' tag from the JSTL taglib to escape this expression.
      See https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jsp/jstl_function_escapexml.htm or
